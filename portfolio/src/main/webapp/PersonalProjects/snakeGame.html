            <p> This was my first real programming project. I was equipped with an impressive amount of programming knowledge from a full 2 weeks of googling "How to program in c++",
                how could I not already be an expert programmer? Seriously, Snake is such an easy game to program, I know of a youtuber who wrote the entire code for the 
                game in under 10 minutes, which is why I was not suprised when it took me 2 weeks to get my program to work. Did I look like I knew what I was doing?
                Anyway its done now, if you want to see it you can check out my github.
