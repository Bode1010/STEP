        <h1> A* Pathfinding </h1>
        <p> A long time ago I dreamed of being a game developer, but alas, tragedy struck when I realized that game
            developers were overworked and don't make that much money. However, before my dreams were shattered I started
            taking steps towards making a game of my own. Even though the game itself was never completed, I required Pathfinding
            to enable my enemies navigate the terrain and find my player. When I gave up on game design, I transformed 
            the project into a stand alone program that was pretty to look at. You can see the results on my github page.
