        <h1> Deep Q learning Agent Drives around a track</h1>
        <p> Heavily inspired by a youtuber (whose project idea I definitely didn't steal *cough cough*) and driven by my love for machine learning I decided
            that I was ready and able to create a Deep Q Reinforcement learning agent from scratch with nothing but a computer and metric tons of free time.
            Before this project started, I was at the top of the world, thinking myself to be a somewhat capable programmer/mathematician. Oh how wrong I was.
            As I slowly descended into madness while attempting to debug the code, I quesitoned if it was really worth the effort it took to make this program.
            Now that I have completed it and everything is working as planned, I can confidently say it was not, and I will NEVER attempt anything like that again...
            I hope.
