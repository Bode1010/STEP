            </div>
            <p> Heavily inspired by a youtuber (whose project idea I definitely didn't steal *cough cough*) and driven by my love for machine learning I decided
                that I was ready and able to create a Deep Q Reinforcement learning agent from scratch with nothing but a computer and metric tons of free time.
                Before this project started, I was at the top of the world, thinking myself to be a somewhat capable programmer/mathematician. Oh how wrong I was.
                As I slowly descended into madness while attempting to debug the code, I quesitoned if it was really worth the effort it took to make this program.
                Now that I have completed it and everything is working as planned, I can confidently say it was not, and I will NEVER attempt anything like that again...
                I hope.
