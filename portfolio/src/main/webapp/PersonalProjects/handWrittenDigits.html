        <h1> Handwritten Digit Identifying Neural Network </h1>
        <p> 
            Now, many people may not know this, but real programmers usually spend 2 days automating what can be done in 2 minutes, and let me tell you, I am 
            the realest programmer there is. After a week researching Convolutional Neural Networks, and a 3 day sprint implementing one on my already existing
            neural network code, I produced a masterpiece in c++ that a python programmer with tensorflow could probably achieve in about 15 minutes give or take. 
            I trained my convolutional neural network on 30k images from the mnist dataset for 7 hours to achieve about an 80% accuracy on the dataset, while some
            youtuber trained his tensorflow network on 60k images from mnist for 4 hours and achieved an accuracy in the high 90's. In the end, my program isnt the 
            best out there, but if you want to take a look, it's on my github.
