        <h1> Minecraft </h1>
        <p> Ah yes, a calming game with soothing music that should be played to relieve stress. Unfortunately, I am no longer as enamored with
            the game as I once was. When asked to play with my friend group I politely decline. Why? Because there are few things more annoying than
            peacefully mining next to a pool of lava only to turn around to the unfortunate hissing sound of a family of creepers out on a nice 
            evening stroll to ruin my day.
