            <p> I love league of legends. Really, it seems like a nice game. However, let me tell you, there is nothing more discouraging 
                than getting your butt handed to you by some toxic 8 year old who is trying to convince you that he has private relations
                with your mother. My main problem with the game is that there are too many characters, abilities and items and with my whopping
                record of 1 (one) games played, I cannot be bothered to learn them all. I only added this game to the list because I wanted to 
                have 4 games and it's the first one that came to mind.
