            <p> A new free to play game whose beta is about to end, Valorant is my favourite game. Now, I dont mean to toot my own horn here
                but let me just say, I am amazing at Valorant. With no hours put into CS:GO and about 10 hours put into paladins (a free to play ripoff of overwatch) 
                it should come as no surprise that I am Iron 1 at valorant with an impressive 1/10 Kill-Death ratio. As a matter of fact, my skills are so
                good I was seriously considering ending my programming career to become a pro valorant player, but I decided to wait and see how this whole 
                "Google" "Internship" thing panned out first.
